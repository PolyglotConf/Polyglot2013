## Sessions

Open-space conference sessions are 100% attendee driven. Attendees propose the
session topics, vote to select the ones with the most interest and help to
facilitate the sessions themselves. However, in order to give people a taste of
what they can expect we've started the session selection process online.

**Head on over to the [User Voice](http://polyglotconf.uservoice.com) site and
look at what other attendees are proposing, vote and even propose your own
sessions.**

We hope this gives you a better idea of what to expect at the conference and you
can get feedback on your own suggestions earlier. We expect this will really add
to the open-space experience for everyone, even those who are new to it.

### Session Proposal Mini-FAQ:

Q: What are my responsibilities when proposing a session?  
A: You are generally expected to *facilitate* the session. This typically means
showing up, determining the format of the session (presentation, open
discussion, fishbowl, etc.) and seeding the discussion if necessary. Don't
worry you can get help, or even pass of the responsibilities to another
interested party.

Q: Should I know a lot about any topic I propose a session for?  
A: It doesn't hurt to propose topics you feel comfortable you can share your
knowledge on, but it is far from necessary.  In fact it is highly encouraged to
propose sessions you are a novice in and are interested in learning about from
other attendees. This helps those with the knowledge know who is interested in
what they have to share, and how much interest there is.

Q: I'm worried, what if **no one** shows up to my topic?  
A: No worries, it doesn't happen often, but from time to time the popularly of
other sessions completely eclipses another. Just pick up your pride, dust it off
and head on over to learn and share at one of the other active sessions. Follow
