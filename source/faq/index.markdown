__Q__: What's this conference about, really? Is it just another programming
conference?

__A__: Just another programming conference? Now what's the problem with that? 

Actually, Polyglot is hoping to be a bit more than that. So this is also about
the art of creating great software and not *just* about code. What it *is* about
is solving real problems, and applying the most effective tools towards that
goal. In the end though, creating great software *must* ultimately lead to code,
but we understand that code is a means to an end and not an end in and of
itself. 

In that spirit, we do hope to see the attendees sessions to discuss
things like interaction design and UX, creating startups, improving community
and more.  However, be warned, code happens, code must happen and much of this
conference will be about the code.

__Q__: Am I expected to know more than one programming language?

__A__: Of course not. The point of Polyglot is to encourage learning and exploring, not to
require it. Bring what you know and share it. Learn from those who are doing
something different and interesting. That's all that is expected of attendees.

---

__Q__: Do I need to know any languages?

__A__: As mentioned in the first question coding is not the only thing that
contributes to creating great software and not everyone who contributes to
building software writes code. That being said ,this event, and it's attendees
are going to be people deeply vested in the process of building and designing
software, which always leads back to the code. It will help a lot, for you to at
least be interested in that aspect of the process.

To put it another way, creating great software is about solving problems not
just thinking them up. That means getting s%&t done and making things happen. If
that's you, then I have no doubt you will fit right in. If you have your doubts
please feel free to contact us and ask some questions. We want this to be
an event where everyone who attends can both contribute a bit and learn a lot.

__Q__: I'm not really a "developer" professionally but I'm learning to code and
I'm interested.

__A__: Let me re-iterate on this again, "interested" is the only serious
pre-requisite here. If you're not interested the main problem is that you'll
probably be very bored.

---

__Q__: I'm a beginner and don't feel like I would be able to contribute much,
will I enjoy this?

__A__: Absolutely! Come and learn as much as you can. Don't
be afraid to ask lots of questions and walk up and talk to the intimidating
looking "rock star" devs. You'll get the most out of it this way.

---

__Q__: I'm an intimidating "rock star" developer.

__A__: That's not really a question, but stop being so damn intimidating. Ask
the quiet and possibly bewildered looking newbies if they have questions, go up
and introduce yourself to people. This is an open space, and your responsibility
is to help facilitate and encourage learning and sharing.

__Q__: Is this going some macho brogramming sausage-fest?

__A__: Wow, we really and truly hope not, but we also know how this can be a
problem. We have some awesome women helping us organize this event and
working to ensure it will be open and inclusive. This is at the core of the
philosophy of Polyglot and we fully expect it well be an attitude that is
embodied by all those attending.
