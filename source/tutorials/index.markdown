### [Demystify the Web: Build a Dynamic HTTP Server from Scratch](#http)

Pre-conference tutorials will be all day Friday, May 25th. The tutorials are being run by sponsors of the conference and co-promoted, but are delivered by the organizations themselves. For convenience, [tickets to the tutorials may be done through Eventbrite](http://polyglotconf2012.eventbrite.com) at the same time as you are purchasing tickets.

## GitHub's Git Foundations Workshop with Matthew McCullough

Distributed version control is all the rage these days, but is it worth it? It
has been transformative for the dozens of organizations and thousands of
developers that I've mentored on the unique implementation called Git. But don't
take my word for it. Discover the joy of a version control system that works for
you, not against you, in a hands-on workshop. 

Bring a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop and we'll install, set up, use and bend
Git into workflows that weren't even possible with the version control systems
of yesteryear. Be prepared to rethink how lightweight, fast, and refreshing
source code control can be. After completing this workshop you'll be able to do
practical work with Git for your day job or weekend OSS hobby.

Highlights of this workshop include:

* Creating local repositories.
* Seeing Git as a content tracker (not just file tracker ).
* Understanding Git network operations, including cloning, remotes, pushing &
  pulling.
* Branching for experiments, stories, and features.
* Merging branches, tags, and arbitrary hashes with recursive and fast-forward
  outcomes.
* Rebasing for code change clarity, unification, and history linearity.

## Introduction to Erlang by Spawngrid

New is well forgotten old. You may have noticed that in these days of a higher demand for concurrent, fault-tolerant applications, people talk more and more about Erlang. Some try to copy its most prominent features to other languages. Erlang has been around for about 20 years now and is a solid piece of a battlefield-proven technology. 

What's all this buzz about? Learn it first hand.

This hands on tutorial will give you an introduction to the Erlang programming language. You will learn the basics of how to read, write and structure Erlang programs. We start with an insight into the theory and concepts behind sequential and concurrent Erlang, allowing you to get acquainted with the Erlang syntax and semantics. We conclude with an overview of the error handling mechanisms used to build fault tolerant systems with five nines availability. 
 
In order to get the most out of this tutorial, you must have a good grasp of other programming languages. This will be a hands on tutorial. Make sure you come with your laptop having installed Erlang (https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl) and your favourite editor.

Attendees will also get a discount for a three day Erlang Express course that will follow shortly after.

Yurii Rashkovskii is a software enthusiast with over 10 years professional experience holding a true passion for how software is created, throughout the whole lifecycle from designing, implementing to testing, deployment and maintenance. Yurii has been using Erlang on and off since 2001 for commercial and open source projects, always returning to it from his endeavours with other platforms. Among other things, his open source Erlang work includes erlzmq2, beam.js, htoad, seqbind & exportie, proper_stdlib, evfs, socket.io-erlang, agner, epitest and EEP 39 implementation. 

He is a public speaker at international Erlang conferences (Erlang Factory & EUC), co-organizer of the Vancouver Erlang Meetup, and co-founder of Spawngrid.

_Note: It is required that your bring a laptop with permissions sufficiently
open to install new apps. Wireless Internet access is provided._

## Demystify the Web: Build a Dynamic HTTP Server from Scratch

We will cover just enough networking and HTTP to build a simple working server.
You will finish this tutorial with a 100 line HTTP server and completely
understand it. We'll be working in Python, but this content transcends language
and is useful in nearly every language and OS. This will be a hands-on tutorial
with three labs.

Modern web frameworks hide most of the messy details of web programming and
present a powerful abstration for us to work with. Unfortunately, they often
hide the simplicity of HTTP itself. If you're new to web programming, or have
only used frameworks, it is hard to see exactly what an HTTP header is, or how
an HTTP verb is specified on the wire. In this tutorial, we're going to start at
the bottom, and work our way up to the HTTP fundamentals common to all web
frameworks. As complex as web programming can be, we'll see that HTTP is clear
and simple.

We will look at basic TCP/IP, the socket abstraction, request/response
protocols, HTTP verbs, and HTTP headers.  Each of these is a topic worthy of in
depth study itself... but we're going to skim them all, taking just what we need
to build a working HTTP server.

#### Prerequisites:

* Comfortability with some programming language: variables, string manipulation,
  for loops and function calls.
* You will need a laptop with Python 2.x installed. (2.7 recommended).
* It will be convenient to have either GIT or SVN installed.
