## GitHub's Git Foundations Workshop with Matthew McCullough

Distributed version control is all the rage these days, but is it worth it? It
has been transformative for the dozens of organizations and thousands of
developers that I've mentored on the unique implementation called Git. But don't
take my word for it. Discover the joy of a version control system that works for
you, not against you, in a hands-on workshop. 

Bring a Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop and we'll install, set up, use and bend
Git into workflows that weren't even possible with the version control systems
of yesteryear. Be prepared to rethink how lightweight, fast, and refreshing
source code control can be. After completing this workshop you'll be able to do
practical work with Git for your day job or weekend OSS hobby.

Highlights of this workshop include:

* Creating local repositories.
* Seeing Git as a content tracker (not just file tracker ).
* Understanding Git network operations, including cloning, remotes, pushing &
  pulling.
* Branching for experiments, stories, and features.
* Merging branches, tags, and arbitrary hashes with recursive and fast-forward
  outcomes.
* Rebasing for code change clarity, unification, and history linearity.

## Introduction to Erlang by Spawngrid

New is well forgotten old. You may have noticed that in these days of a higher demand for concurrent, fault-tolerant applications, people talk more and more about Erlang. Some try to copy its most prominent features to other languages. Erlang has been around for about 20 years now and is a solid piece of a battlefield-proven technology. 

What's all this buzz about? Learn it first hand.

This hands on tutorial will give you an introduction to the Erlang programming language. You will learn the basics of how to read, write and structure Erlang programs. We start with an insight into the theory and concepts behind sequential and concurrent Erlang, allowing you to get acquainted with the Erlang syntax and semantics. We conclude with an overview of the error handling mechanisms used to build fault tolerant systems with five nines availability. 
 
In order to get the most out of this tutorial, you must have a good grasp of other programming languages. This will be a hands on tutorial. Make sure you come with your laptop having installed Erlang (https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl) and your favourite editor.

Attendees will also get a discount for a three day Erlang Express course that will follow shortly after.
