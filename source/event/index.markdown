The Polyglot Conference is a 1 day uncoference which is joined by a day of
pre-conference tutorials and (tentatively) followed by an all-day hackathon (more
details on the hackathon coming soon).

The conference itself is a one-day [__unconference__][unconference] (also called
an open-space). This is a self-organized conference where attendees work to
propose, select, organize and participate in the tracks and sessions for the
conference.  If you've attended an unconference/open-space before then you
already know how amazing these events are. If you have never attended one, then
you are in for a real treat.
