The Polyglot Conference is a 1 day unconference which is joined by a day of
pre-conference tutorials.

The conference itself is a one-day [__unconference__][unconference] (also called
an open-space). This is a self-organized conference where attendees work to
propose, select, organize and participate in the tracks and sessions for the
conference.  If you've attended an unconference/open-space before then you
already know how amazing these events are. If you have never attended one, then
you are in for a real treat.

What will the conference be about? We've got a [session suggestions forum](http://polyglotconf.uservoice.com), or click on the "sessions & talks" tab at left to see what's been submitted so far.

## Registration

Tickets are $35 and include a drink ticket at the after party. Friday tutorials do not include conference tickets, so please make sure to add one of each to your checkout.
