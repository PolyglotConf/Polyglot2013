## CALLOUT FOR VOLUNTEERS: VANCOUVER POLYGLOT CONFERENCE 2012!

Want to learn how to create great software, from industry experts…. FOR FREE?

Want to network with industry professionals (eg: network with our sponsors,
Mozilla, Github, Clio…) so you have a summer job, a job lined up out of
graduation or even a job, period?

Heck, let’s say you have all that and an awesome personality to boot. Wouldn’t
you want to be part of the cool crowd that organizes these intellectually
stimulating conferences (while making the world a better place through your
volunteerism, of course)?

### TIME COMMITMENT:

Saturday, May 26, 2012: Two shifts: morning/registration (7:30am-12:30pm) and afternoon/clean up (1:30pm-6:30pm) 

### WHAT YOU GET:

* Waiver of conference fees.
* $5 Coffee Card, for a cafe like Caffé Artigiano (for all your late night programming needs)
* $10 Gift certificate to great bar/restaurants like the Donnelly Club group
* Be part of history in the making (you will have bragging rights for being part of the first annual Vancouver Polyglot conference in Vancouver)
* An opportunity to learn, meet awesome people and have fun!
