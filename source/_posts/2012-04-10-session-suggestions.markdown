Most unconferences wait until the first day of the conference before you get a glimpse of what the sessions will be.  We just couldn't wait that long and wanted to give you a head start to get your Polyglot juices flowing, and to give people a glimpse at what kind of sessions they can expect.

We're using [UserVoice](http://polyglotconf.uservoice.com) to let people browse, suggest, and vote for a session.  We'd love to hear what sessions you like to attend and you can do that by voting for the ones that appeal to you the most.  You only get three votes, but don't worry, you can always change your vote if a new hot session pops up after you've already distributed your votes.

What's even better than getting to vote for your favourite session?  Suggesting your own session, of course!  We encourage all of you to add your own session suggestion on a topic that you think is missing so far.  Just tell us what language, technology or topic you want to talk about or participate in.  Give us a quick description of the session, maybe say something about the format, and then start promoting your session. We'll be tweeting all suggestions on the [@PolyglotConf Twitter account](http://twitter.com/PolyGlotConf) with the #sessionsuggestion tag.

We'll have an announcement later on letting you know exactly how we're going to combine these sessions with our regular unconference opening, so stay tuned.  But in the meantime, let us know what you want to talk about at [polyglotconf.uservoice.com](http://polyglotconf.uservoice.com), or click on the "sessions & talks" tab.
