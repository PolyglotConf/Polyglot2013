[Parveen Kaler](http://twitter.com/kaler) is one of the organizers of Polyglot. Here's his [blog post](http://parveenkaler.com/2012/04/08/polyglotconf-vancouver-2012/) on why you should attend Polyglot:

<blockquote>
The problem with most technology conferences is that they devolve into cliques.

Game developers don’t interact with mobile developers. Mobile developers don’t interact with web developers. Web developers don’t interact with systems developers. And on and on it goes.

PolyglotConf is a one day unconference designed to get 200 of the smartest developers around in the same room. An uncoference is a participant-driven, self-organizing meeting. The people that show the day of the conference are the ones that get drive the agenda. The job of the organizers is to facilitate.
