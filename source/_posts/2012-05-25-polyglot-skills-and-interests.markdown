On the eve of the Polyglot main conference day, here are a couple of charts from the registration questions we asked. This is an interesting contrast to the [pre-launch interest levels](/blog/2012/03/14/technology-interest-levels/).

Not everyone filled out the questions, and for those that registered multiple attendees the questions weren't filled out, so consider this very rough data. At the same time, it's an interesting snapshot of the programming languages and technologies that are of interest today.

##Skills of Participants
We asked participants to list their strongest skills:

[{% img /images/strongest_tech.png 600 %}](/images/strongest_tech.png)

A lot of our organizing committee is from an ALT.NET background<sup>[1](#altnet)</sup>, so the strong showing from C# / .NET is not surprising.

##Technology Interest
We asked participants which programming language, framework, or technology are you most interested in learning more about. This was a free form text field that we asked people to comma separate.

[{% img /images/tech_learn_barchart.png 600 %}](/images/tech_learn_barchart.png)

The "long tail" is particularly interesting (everything from F# down had just one person list it as an interest), as well as the complete absence of C# from _this_ list.

##See you tomorrow!
We'll see everyone tomorrow at 8:30am at SFU Harbour Centre for registration and topic planning.

Remember - [vote for the session suggestions](http://polyglotconf.uservoice.com/) or add your own based on what you've seen here. Just putting down a language or tech you're interested in is a great way to start gathering interest.

Check the [new session suggestions](http://polyglotconf.uservoice.com/forums/156120-session-suggestions/filters/new) for some additional placeholder topics we've put in place based on the interest results.

### Footnotes

<sup><a name="altnet">1</a></sup>Jeremy D. Miller's post on [What is ALT.NET?](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc337902.aspx) makes for good reading, especially this quote:

You reach outside the mainstream to adopt the best of any community: Open Source, Agile, Java, Ruby. In no way does Microsoft or the .NET community have a monopoly on good software development. For instance, Agile processes and Design Patterns started with Smalltalk. Likewise, Inversion of Control tools and techniques originated in Java. And two fundamental Ruby on Rails principles—Don't Repeat Yourself and Convention over Configuration—are ones that we can adopt in .NET.
