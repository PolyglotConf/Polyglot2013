Before the site went up, we had linked to an image of the chart of interest that people had in different technologies.

{% img /images/polyglot_language_interest.png 800 %}

As you can see, the top 4 technologies of interest are:

1. node.js
2. Ruby
3. Python
4. Haskell

As [Allen Pike](http://twitter.com/apike) pointed out, node.js isn't a *language* (and neither is .NET), so we actually did label this wrong initially. We've setup questions on the [registration form](http://polyglotconf2012.eventbrite.com) to ask people more broadly both what their strongest technology is, as well as the technologies that they're interested in learning more about.

Not shown on this chart is the "other" category we had - probably the biggest area of interest was in a variety of NoSQL database technologies.

The biggest question we've had after sending out invitations and formally opening registration yesterday is "What is this going to be about? There isn't enough information to help me figure out what will be discussed." This is pretty common with unconferences for people who haven't experienced this style before. The answer comes from open space - "Whoever comes is the right people". We've reserved a space, set the date, and we're inviting different programming communities to come together to have whatever discussions they're interested in having.

We will also be providing a place online ahead of time for people to discover what other attendees are passionate about discussing, to get a better sense of the type of talks you can expect to be involved in. For now, feel free to start prepping discussion topics by posting to your blog, Github account, or elsewhere. Tag it with #polyglotconf, and we'll highlight the ones we find.
