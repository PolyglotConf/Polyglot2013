We're pleased to announce that [Clio](http://www.goclio.com) and [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) are premium [sponsors](/sponsors).

Clio will be helping to caffeinate you by providing some Artigiano coffee cards. Clio is a local Vancouver company that provides a web-based practice management for the entrepreneurs of the legal industry: solos and small firms. 

Mozilla is our drinks sponsor alongside GitHub, and is also stepping up to host a [Hackathon on Sunday](/hackathon). Mozilla is a global, nonprofit organization dedicated to making the Web better. The Mozilla Vancouver office is one of their global locations, and will be moving into new space in May.

We have a handful of community sponsorships left if you're interested in getting involved with Polyglot.
