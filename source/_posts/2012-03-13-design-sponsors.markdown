We put out a call for help with design and branding for the conference. All of the organizers are technical people, so we knew we had to get help. Luckily, [Clayton Correia](http://claytoncorreia.com/)  and [Terra Spitzner](http://terraspitzner.com/) volunteered to make a logo and matching site design as an in kind sponsorship.

We knew we were in good hands when they sent us a preview of the logo along with a branding guide that had the following tips for us:

<ol>  <li>Do not place on top of crazy images or with gross colours. Yuk.</li>  <li>Do not muddle with the logo. It is awesome the way it is, trust me.</li>  <li>Do not rotate the logo. Just ‘cause.</li>  <li>Do not add anything to the logo to make it “pop”. Drop shadows, rainbows, lense flares and anything else ridiculous.</li>
</ol>

Final words at the bottom of the guide? "Thanks for looking! Now you know how to be awesome."

We're excited to get the logo and design up and running - thanks Clayton & Terra!

_Note: Depending on when you're looking at this post, the design may or may not already be implemented. We're using [Octopress](http://octopress.org), a static file blogging engine to run the site, and just got started with the default theme. Got suggestions on the info on this site? Well, conveniently, you can actually [fork it on Github](https://github.com/PolyglotConf/polyglotconf.github.com/tree/source) and make a pull request to suggest changes!_
