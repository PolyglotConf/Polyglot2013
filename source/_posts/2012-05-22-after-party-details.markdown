Thanks to our [drinks sponsors](/sponsors/) GitHub and Mozilla, we'll be providing attendees that want to continue on having a good time after the conference sessions end with a $10 gift certificate to a fine provider of libations.

Continuing with the unconference theme, we decided to select a number of venues in and around Gastown. This gives attendees a chance to go off in smaller groups and continue the discussions from the day. We'll be handing out a random gift certificate with each registration, which is another chance to get to meet different people, or to mix and match to build your own Gastown food & drink adventure. Think of it as an un-party!

As well as the drinks sponsors, [Clio](http://www.goclio.com/) is going to be caffeinating you. We've got Artigiano coffee cards that you'll also get first thing in the morning, for you to use as you like either first thing or at lunch time to get your caffeine fix. The closest [Artigiano location is on Hastings at Howe](https://www.caffeartigiano.com:3691/Location_Vancouver_Hastings.aspx).
