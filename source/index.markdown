We, the Polyglot 2012 organizers, are very excited to be bringing you the first
(annual?) Polyglot __un__-conference. An entirely non-denominational software
development conference that is about software development and nothing but.

So what’s Polyglot development really about? It’s simple, it's about software
development, not dogma. It's about being open-minded and pragmatic when it
counts, unfettered by one-size-fits-all prescriptions. Languages, frameworks,
techniques, whatever expands your skills and ability to create software fits the
bill here. So even if you you only regularly use one or two languages (lets face
it X and javascript right?) that’s not what matters here.

Even more importantly the Polyglot Conference is centered around the goal of
bringing together real _problem solvers_. People who don't just carry around an
idea or a problem in their head and talk a lot, but the men and women who get
down and dirty and _do something about it!_ These beautiful people who _make
the magic happen_. 

So if you think this describes you, or even if we've simply convinced you that
this describes _the person you wish to become_. Then believe us when we say this
conference was created specifically for you.

Or heck, don't believe us and come find out. I mean the tickets are $35, what
have you got to loose!?

Here are some important things you should know (conveniently in point form for
you skimmers):

* This is an open space event or un-conference. Sessions are planned by the
  attendees, the content and value comes from all of you.
* We are a completely non-denominational event with respect to languages,
  environment, heck even religion. This is all about software development and
  the people who make it happen.
* It is open to current and aspiring polyglots, multiple language use/knowledge
  is not required.
* Its open to people of all experience levels who are interested in learning,
  sharing or teaching.
* It is open to anyone who is (or aspires to be) a problem solver, who works to
  get real things done and make things happen.
* There will be organized workshops in advance of the event.
* There will be a P.A.R.T.Y. (it will be E.P.I.C.)
* You _will_ have to pay a nominal ($35) fee which shows you're commitment to
  being there and being involved (apologies to the “open spaces are free”
  zealots).
* It will _not_ suck. If you haven't been to an open-space before it is
  understandable to be skeptical that such a thing could actually work. If you
  have you know exactly why it's pretty much always awesome. If you need to be
  convinced ask someone who's been. Oh wait, I've been, well consider yourself
  convinced.

### The FAQs

I've also compiled a little [FAQ](/faq) which includes this and more in
convenient Q/A form for those who both skimmed the intro and are averse to point
form information. The FAQ will be kept up to date as people ask questions and
give us feedback and as we have more details on the event.

### Staying Informed

Also we have a [blog](/blog) section which will updated with announcements on
the pre-conference [tutorials](/tutorials), the (tentatively planned)
post-conference hackathon, the session planning and selection and much more. If
you are planning on attending __I highly recommend subscribing to the blog,
following [@polyglotconf](http://twitter.com/polyglotconf) on Twitter or at
least checking back often__.

### See you in May
