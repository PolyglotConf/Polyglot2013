We are very excited to be bringing you the first Polyglot __un__-conference. An entirely non-denominational software
development conference that is about software development and nothing but.

The event is being held in Vancouver, BC at SFU Harbour Centre, on *Saturday, May 26th, 2012*. Tickets are $35 and [available now through Eventbrite Â»](https://polyglotconf2012.eventbrite.com/)

What will the conference be about? We've got a [session suggestions forum](http://polyglotconf.uservoice.com), or click on the "sessions & talks" tab at left to see what's been submitted so far.

Also check out the [Tutorials](/tutorials) on Friday, and the [Hackathon](/hackathon) on Sunday.
