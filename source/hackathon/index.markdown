[Mozilla Vancouver](https://twitter.com/#!/mozillayvr) will be hosting a hackathon at their [brand new Vancouver offices](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/contact.html#map-canada-vancouver) in the Flack Block building on the Sunday after the  conference. We  are also really excited to welcome hack day sponsor Nodejitsu who will  be on-site to help people get up and running quickly with free beta Nodejitsu accounts!<

The first rule for the hack day is there are NO RULES. Mozilla is happy to host any sort of hacking you may have in mind, we just want to create a space where you can take all the great ideas from Polyglot on Saturday and build things. The schedule will run something like this:<
 
    * 09:00 -> Doors open, intro talk ( what we're doing, etc )
    * 09:20 -> 10:00ish: Coffee, chatting, whiteboards, project inception 
    * 12:00 -> Lunch
    * 13:00ish -> more hacking 
    * 14:30ish -> more coffee 
    * 17:00 -> wrap-up, demos

Of course, Mozillians will be on hand to field questions about various Mozilla projects:

* Firefox mobile for Android
* Firefox mobile for Android<
* 'Boot to Gecko' mobile operating system
* Persona identiy service for web applications
* Mozilla marketplace - a marketplace for HTML5 apps
* Firefox developer tools &amp; add-ons
