Mozilla Vancouver will be hosting a hackathon at their brand new Vancouver offices in the Flack Block building on the Sunday after the conference. The day will be an opportunity to get more familiar with some of the open source initiatives that Mozilla is working on, as well as get support from the developers involved with those projects.

Some of the projects include:

* [Boot2Gecko](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Booting_to_the_Web) - Mozilla's open source phone project, to have a web-based cellphone operating system
* [BrowserID](https://browserid.org/) - single signon hosted by your browser; externally, this is known as [Mozilla Persona](http://identity.mozilla.com/)
* [Firefox on Android](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Booting_to_the_Web) - the Firefox browser on Android
* [Mozilla Marketplace](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/apps/) - a web-based appstore

Stay tuned for more details on the hackathon. Preference will be given to [conference attendees](http://polyglotconf2012.eventbrite.com/).
