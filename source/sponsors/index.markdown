## Github

{% img left /images/baracktocat.jpg 300 %}

A big thanks to Github for not only arranging our first pre-conference
[tutorial](/tutorials#github) but also for sponsoring the event and helping to
make it happen. Few organizations are as committed to the idea of _polyglot_ as
Github is. 

Github has quickly become a central part of the open source ecosystem and is
also huge catalyst for the proliferation of open source. The Polyglot
Conference would like to thank them not only for their sponsorship and
support---and for hosting this site---but also for the powerful example they set every
day by what they do.
