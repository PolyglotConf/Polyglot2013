Octopress instance for [Polyglot Conf](http://www.polyglotconf.com).

These are adapted from basic Octopress setup instructions:

* checkout the _source_ branch of this repo
* make sure that you have your ruby and Octopress dependencies installed (see http://octopress.org/docs/setup/), but skip the step of cloning octopress / installing the theme 
* setup deploying to Github http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/ -- NOTE: don't do _rake deploy_, this WILL publish pages live
* follow http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/ for new pages and posts
* use _rake preview_ to see what it will look like on your local machine (visit http://localhost:4000 to browse through the site)
* commit your edits to source as needed, do _rake deploy_ when you are ready to have the pages go live
